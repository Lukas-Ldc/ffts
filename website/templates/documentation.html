            <p>For the XLSX files, from Excel or Libre Office you can save as CSV. Sometimes the data is altered by the software (ex : the date) and the importation might not work. You also have to remove the first line with the columns names.</p>

            </ul>
            <p>Depending on the type of importation, you can have the followings parameters:</p>

            </ul>
            <p>For the transfers, you have to make multiple changes in the CSV file. Because the file is not in the same language for everyone, you have to find your deposits, withdrawals and change operations. You can do it automatically with a find an replace option.
                In column number 6, replace with the following values : "DEPOSIT", "WITHDRAWAL", "CHANGE_IN" and "CHANGE_OUT". <i>Can be improved by sending me the file in order to automate it in your language.</i></p>
