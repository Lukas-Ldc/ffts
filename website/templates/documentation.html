                <p>The accounts linked to the import have to be added before. For the transfer import, you can precise the name (user_name) of the account that will be replaced by the actual account.

                <p>For the locked subscription (POS Interests) : will only import the interests after subscription + redemption detected in the same CSV.
                If you have more than one stake for the same asset which overlap and one of them has been cancelled, the numbers won't be correct.
                If you have for the same asset a flexible and a locked subscription, the numbers won't be correct.</p>
                <p>When importing transfers between accounts (C2C), you can use "Manual (Crypto D/W only)" to automatically link the transfers with the right accounts.
                    In order to work, you have to replace inside the CSV file the column containing the address with the unique ID of the FFTS account.</p>

                <p>For the transfers, you have to make multiple changes in the CSV file. Because the file is not in the same language for everyone, you have to find your deposits, withdrawals and change operations in order to rename a column so it can be detected. You can do it automatically with a find an replace option.
                    In column number 6, replace with the following values : "DEPOSIT", "WITHDRAWAL", "CHANGE_IN" and "CHANGE_OUT". Supported languages (modifications not needed) : French. <i>Can be improved by sending me the file in order to automate it in your language.</i></p>
